# Smokey-VII-Fan-Club
Arduino Code for Project 1

## To set up git on your computer download git 
https://git-scm.com/  
This should also come with a terminal called git bash which you will use  
  
To learn basic navigation in git bash watch this:

## To copy code from github onto your computer  
YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO DO THIS ONCE  
In git bash, navigate to the folder where you want to put all of the code and copy from the website
'git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-Tyler/Smokey-VII-Fan-Club.git'

## To start editing files yourself  
Start your own working branch with your name:
'git checkout your-name-here'  
Update the code on your computer to be the most recent version:  
'git pull origin main'  
  
## To push your edited code to GitHub
Copy lines into terminal after editing your code with your own commit message:  
'git status'  
'git add .'  
'git commit -m "your message here"'  
'git push origin main'  

Please make sure your commit messages are short (less than 40 characters), and are descriptive
